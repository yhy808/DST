# Daylight Saving Time and Road Safety in the United Kingdom
Authors: Hongyi Yu; Jeffrey Emmons; Katie Hansen; Yuqing Yang

This study investigates the relationship between Daylight Saving Time (DST) and road safety in the United Kingdom from 2012 to 2017. Using data from the Harvard Review of Economics and Statistics, our analysis aims to show the effects of DST on road accidents in multiple aspects. It also compares trends in road safety for different regions in the UK by using spatial analysis. Our results show a statistically significant change in road accidents when time shifts from regular time to DST, and vice versa. The results of this study could potentially be utilized to increase safety precautions and awareness around annual time shifting as well as be utilized as scientific resources in the debate over whether or not to continue with the Daylight Saving Time practice.
